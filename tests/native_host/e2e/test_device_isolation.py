"""E2E tests for kernel-enforced device isolation (cgroup-v2 BPF device filter).

spurd attaches a default-deny ``BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_DEVICE`` program to each
job's cgroup, so unlike the ``*_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` deny in ``test_gpu_deny.py``
no re-exported variable can undo it. ``/dev/kfd`` is the probe because it
reaches a job's allow-list only through a real allocation and lives outside the
``/dev/dri`` the namespace wrapper swaps for a tmpfs, so a denial there can
only be the filter. Loading it needs root, hence ``@pytest.mark.rootful``.
