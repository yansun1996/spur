Interactive & Parallel Jobs
===========================

Not every job is a batch script. Use ``spur run`` (Slurm ``srun``) to run a
command directly as a job or job step, ``spur alloc`` (Slurm ``salloc``) to get
an interactive shell on allocated resources, and ``spur attach`` (Slurm
``sattach``) to connect to a running job's input and output. This page covers
all three and how to request GPUs for them.

Run a Command — ``srun``
------------------------

``spur run`` (Slurm ``srun``) runs a command as a job and streams its output
live. It operates in two modes:

- **Standalone** — when run outside an allocation, it submits a new job, waits
  for the allocation, streams output from the node agent, and exits with the
  job's exit code. Pressing Ctrl-C cancels the job. After the allocation is
  granted, standalone ``srun`` (including ``--pty``) resolves the job owner from
  the controller for step, keepalive, and cancel RPCs, the same way
  ``srun`` does
  inside an ``salloc`` shell via ``SPUR_JOB_USER``.
- **Step mode** — when run inside an existing allocation (``SPUR_JOB_ID`` is set,
  as under ``salloc`` or in a batch script), it creates a *job step* against the
  parent allocation instead of submitting a new job.

Inside an allocation, a bare ``srun`` inherits the allocation's size
(``--ntasks``, ``--cpus-per-task``, nodes, partition, account, QOS), so it runs
at the allocation's scale unless you override on the command line.

Common options:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 10 64

   * - Long
     - Short
     - Description
   * - ``--nodes``
     - ``-N``
     - Number of nodes. Standalone default ``1``; a nested step inherits the
       allocation unless ``-N`` is typed.
   * - ``--ntasks``
     - ``-n``
     - Number of tasks. Standalone default ``1``; a nested step inherits
       ``SPUR_NTASKS`` / ``SLURM_NTASKS`` unless ``-n`` is typed.
   * - ``--cpus-per-task``
     - ``-c``
     - CPUs per task. Default ``1``.
   * - ``--gres``
     -
     - Generic resources, e.g. ``gpu:8``.
   * - ``--gpus``
     - ``-G``
     - GPU shorthand, folded into ``gpu:<val>``.
   * - ``--gpu-bind``
     -
     - Per-task GPU binding: ``closest``, ``map_gpu:...``, ``mask_gpu:...``, or
       ``none``.
   * - ``--partition``
     - ``-p``
     - Partition to run in.
   * - ``--time``
     - ``-t``
     - Wall-clock limit.
   * - ``--pty``
     -
     - Allocate a pseudo-terminal (use with an interactive shell). Inside an
       existing allocation this runs as an interactive step: a single task on
       one node, started in the *job's* environment and working directory
       rather than your shell's. ``srun`` warns about the flags that implies it
       must drop — ``--output``/``--error``/``--input``, the task-sizing flags,
       and ``--cpu-bind``/``--gpu-bind``/``--label``/``--mpi``. ``--chdir`` moves
       the srun prolog/epilog but not the terminal. ``--container-image`` *is*
       honored — the interactive shell runs inside the container (see
       :doc:`running-containers`).
   * - ``--label``
     - ``-l``
     - Prefix each output line with its task rank.
   * - ``--output``
     - ``-o``
     - File for stdout. ``%j`` expands to the job ID; if ``-o`` is set but
       ``-e`` is not, stderr follows stdout.
   * - ``--error``
     - ``-e``
     - File for stderr.
   * - ``--jobid``
     -
     - Target a running job (use with ``--overlap``).
   * - ``--overlap``
     -
     - Share resources with the targeted job's existing steps.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   srun -N2 -n16 --gres=gpu:8 hostname     # parallel command across 2 nodes
   spur run --pty bash                      # interactive shell on an allocated node
   srun -n4 python train.py
   srun --jobid 1024 --overlap rocm-smi     # run a command inside a running job

.. note::

   ``--jobid`` requires ``--overlap``; ``--jobid`` alone is an error.
   ``--input``/``-i`` is ignored in step mode.

Interactive Allocation — ``salloc``
------------------------------------

``spur alloc`` (Slurm ``salloc``) requests an interactive allocation, waits for
it to start (up to 300 seconds), then spawns your ``$SHELL`` with the allocation
environment exported (``SPUR_JOB_ID``, ``SPUR_JOB_USER``, ``SPUR_NODELIST``,
``SPUR_NNODES``, ``SPUR_NTASKS``, ``SPUR_CPUS_PER_TASK``, the
partition/account/QOS variables, and their ``SLURM_*`` twins). When you exit the
shell, the allocation is released. Ctrl-C cancels it.

When authentication is enabled, ``salloc`` also passes ``$SPUR_AUTH_TOKEN`` (or
``~/.spur/token``) into the allocation shell so step commands can authenticate
to the controller. ``SPUR_JOB_USER`` records the job owner bound at submit time
(for example the JWT subject); ``srun`` inside the shell uses it when step RPCs
run without a token.

Inside that shell, ``srun`` runs as a job step. With no step-level ``-N`` or
``-w``, it uses the allocation's nodes and inherits the allocation's task count
(``SPUR_NTASKS`` / ``SLURM_NTASKS``). For **buffered** steps, ``-N``/``--nodes``
limits the step to that many allocated nodes without dropping that inherited
task count, and ``-w``/``--nodelist`` selects an exact subset of allocated
nodes. A step cannot request more nodes than its allocation.

``--pty`` does not follow those node-selection rules: it still ignores
``--nodes`` (one task on one node) and, with ``-w``, uses only the first listed
name.

The ``-N``/``-n`` defaults of 1 apply when ``srun`` submits a **new** job, not
when it runs as a step inside ``salloc``/``sbatch``. Common options: ``--nodes``/
``-N``, ``--ntasks``/``-n``, ``--cpus-per-task``/``-c``, ``--mem``, ``--time``/
``-t``, ``--gres``, ``--gpus``/``-G``, ``--partition``/``-p``, ``--constraint``/
``-C``, ``--nodelist``/``-w``, ``--exclude``/``-x``, ``--reservation``, and
``--exclusive``.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   salloc -N1 --gres=gpu:2 -t 2:00:00
   spur alloc --partition gpu --exclusive

Attach to a Running Job — ``sattach``
-------------------------------------

``spur attach`` (Slurm ``sattach``) connects to a running job's I/O. The
positional argument is ``JOB_ID`` or ``JOB_ID.STEP_ID``; the step-id component is
accepted, but only the job id is used to route the attach. By default it opens a
full interactive raw-mode terminal attached through the node agent. Attach RPCs
use the job owner from ``SPUR_JOB_USER`` (when set), the controller job record, or
the local login name, matching step-mode ``srun`` under JWT authentication.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``--output <stdout|stderr>``
     - Which stream to attach to. Default ``stdout``.
   * - ``--output-only``
     - Stream output one-way instead of an interactive terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

   sattach 1024
   sattach 1024 --output-only --output stderr

Surviving an Agent Restart
--------------------------

Work is supervised by a process that outlives the node agent, so an
administrator restarting or upgrading ``spurd`` does not kill it. An allocation
stays held, a running ``srun`` step keeps running and still reports its exit
status, and a terminal opened inside an allocation is reattached — the session
pauses for the restart and resumes where it was. A step that *finishes* while
the agent is down is covered too: its supervisor records the exit durably, that
record is kept for ten minutes after the step settles, and the restarted agent
answers the waiting caller with the exit and the step's output instead of
reporting the step as lost. Any number of restarts inside that window are
covered; a caller that only comes back after it is still told the step is
unknown.

Two cases are not covered: a step given its own ``--container-image``, and an
``srun --pty`` that allocates its own job rather than running inside an existing
allocation. Both end when the agent stops, and a container step also leaves its
unpacked rootfs behind. To keep a terminal across a restart, take an allocation
first and run ``srun --pty`` inside it:

.. code-block:: bash

   salloc -N1
   srun --pty bash     # inside the allocation shell

Requesting GPUs
---------------

``srun``, ``salloc``, and batch jobs all request GPUs the same way:

.. code-block:: bash

   srun --gres=gpu:2 python infer.py         # 2 GPUs of any type
   srun --gres=gpu:mi300x:8 python train.py  # 8 GPUs of a specific type
   srun -G 4 python infer.py                 # -G shorthand
   salloc --gres=gpu:2 -t 1:00:00

When GPUs are allocated, the job sees them through several variables, each set to
the allocated device ordinals so GPU runtimes find the right devices:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 34 66

   * - Variable
     - Meaning
   * - ``ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES``
     - Allocated GPU ordinals.
   * - ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``
     - Allocated GPU ordinals.
   * - ``GPU_DEVICE_ORDINAL``
     - Allocated GPU ordinals.
   * - ``SPUR_JOB_GPUS``
     - Allocated GPU ordinals (Spur-native).

Under ``srun``, ``--gpu-bind`` adjusts the visible set per task —
``--gpu-bind=closest`` binds each task to its nearest GPU, and
``map_gpu:...``/``mask_gpu:...`` set an explicit per-task mapping or mask.
