Migrating from Slurm
====================

Spur is drop-in compatible with Slurm's command-line interface, REST API, and C
FFI. Most Slurm workloads move over unchanged. This page covers what works as-is,
where the configuration model differs, and the behavioral differences a Slurm user
should know about before switching.

What Works Unchanged
--------------------

The following work without modification:

- **Commands** — ``sbatch``, ``srun``, ``salloc``, ``squeue``, ``sinfo``,
  ``sacct``, ``scancel``, ``scontrol``, and ``sacctmgr`` (via the symlinks
  described in :doc:`/user-guide/slurm-compatibility`).
- **Job script directives** — ``#SBATCH`` directives in batch scripts are parsed
  the same way. ``#PBS`` directives are also converted on a best-effort basis.
- **Environment variables** — Spur sets a ``SLURM_*`` twin for every ``SPUR_*``
  variable it injects into a job, so Slurm-aware software (MPI launchers, training
  frameworks) sees the ``SLURM_*`` names it expects.
- **REST API and C FFI** — the REST surface and the FFI library remain
  Slurm-compatible.

Configuration Differences
-------------------------

Slurm's ``slurm.conf`` and ``slurmdbd.conf`` are replaced by a single TOML file,
``spur.conf`` (default location ``/etc/spur/spur.conf``). Key differences:

- **One config file, one set of daemons.** There is no ``slurmdbd`` and no
  ``slurmrestd`` — accounting and the REST API are served by the controller
  (``spurctld``). Accounting storage is configured under ``[accounting]`` in
  ``spur.conf`` rather than in a separate ``slurmdbd.conf``.
- **Raft-based state.** Controller state is replicated through Raft and persists
  across restarts, so there is no ``StateSaveLocation`` handling to manage
  separately.
- **Built-in high availability.** HA is provided by Raft (openraft) and is always
  on — even a single controller runs a one-member cluster. There is no separate
  backup-controller configuration; add controllers to the Raft cluster instead.

See :doc:`/admin-guide/configuration` for the full ``spur.conf`` reference.

Behavioral Differences and Current Limitations
----------------------------------------------

The commands below accept Slurm syntax, but the following differences apply. Flags
noted as "accepted for compatibility" parse without error but have no effect yet.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Area
     - Difference
   * - Partitions
     - Defined in ``spur.conf``; there is no runtime ``scontrol create/update/delete partition``. Edit the config and reload the controller to change a partition.
   * - ``--noconvert``
     - Accepted for compatibility on ``squeue``, ``sinfo``, ``sacct``, ``sstat``, ``sshare``, and ``sreport``. Spur already reports raw values where applicable (``sinfo``'s memory columns are MB integers; ``squeue`` has no memory column yet), so there is nothing to suppress. ``sstat`` still prints ``MemAlloc`` with an ``M`` suffix whether or not the flag is passed.
   * - ``sacct --jobs``
     - Accepted for compatibility; the job-id filter is not yet applied server-side.
   * - ``sacct`` ``ReqMem``
     - The ``ReqMem`` format field has no value yet and renders empty.
   * - ``sstat``
     - Per-process ``Ave*`` and ``Max*`` metrics (for example ``AveRSS``, ``MaxVMSize``) show ``N/A``.
   * - ``sprio``
     - The ``FAIRSHARE`` column is a placeholder and does not yet reflect usage.
   * - ``sacctmgr`` ``-p``/``-P``
     - Delimited output covers ``show account``, ``show qos``, and ``show txn``; for ``show user``, ``show association``, and ``show tres`` it errors instead of printing a table no script can parse. ``-n`` works for every entity.
   * - ``scancel`` arrays
     - Array-element syntax (``123_4``) is not yet supported client-side; cancel by plain job id.
   * - ``scontrol show``
     - Output is always the multi-line ``Key=Value`` block; there is no ``--oneliner``. Unset diagnostic fields print as ``(null)`` rather than being omitted — notably ``NodeList=(null)`` on a pending job, where earlier Spur releases omitted the line. Note that ``ReqNodeList``, ``ExcNodeList``, and ``SchedNodeList`` all contain the literal ``NodeList=``, and ``ReqNodeList`` is printed first: a script matching ``NodeList=`` without anchoring the field name will now read the requested list instead of the allocated one. Match ``^\s*NodeList=`` (or an equivalent boundary) instead. ``ReqTRES`` omits Slurm's ``billing=`` component, as Spur computes no TRES billing weights. ``MinCPUsNode`` is the per-node CPU floor implied by the task layout, which can read higher than Slurm's ``pn_min_cpus`` for an uneven split such as ``-N2 -n7``. A pending job now reports the scheduler's projected ``StartTime`` (and an ``EndTime`` derived from it) where earlier releases printed ``N/A``, so a script treating ``StartTime != N/A`` as "the job has started" needs to check ``JobState`` instead.
   * - ``scontrol show assoc_mgr``
     - Caps print as ``Limit(Consumed)`` with ``N`` for no limit, as in Slurm, and an ``OverLimit`` field names caps already exceeded. Filters to one user (``users=<name>`` or a bare name); Slurm's ``accounts=``, ``qos=`` and ``flags=`` selectors are not accepted (an unknown ``<key>=`` errors rather than being read as a username). As in Slurm, an unprivileged caller is scoped to their own associations and administrators see every scope. Users are listed on their own lines under a scope rather than nested in a ``User Limits=`` field, and an account's group figures are stated once for the account instead of repeated per association row. Fairshare and priority internals Slurm prints (``SharesRaw``, ``UsageRaw``, ``Lft-Rgt``, ``GrpTRESMins``) are not included.
   * - ``sshare``/``sreport`` usage units
     - ``sshare`` ``RawUsage`` and ``CPURawUsage`` report cpu-seconds, matching Slurm. Prior Spur releases displayed cpu-hours under the same column names. ``sreport`` columns are likewise cpu-seconds. Scripts parsing ``sshare --parsable`` output will see values 3600× larger than before. Upgrade ``spurctld`` and ``spur-cli`` together to avoid a mixed-unit window.
   * - QOS ``GrpWall``
     - Enforced at scheduling admission only: an over-budget QOS stops admitting jobs, and running jobs are never killed where Slurm cancels them. Consumption is a trailing window (``grp_wall_window_days`` under ``[accounting]``) rather than decayed usage, and the cap exists on a QOS only, not on an association. See :ref:`grpwall-budgets`.

Accounting and QOS Mapping
--------------------------

Accounting entities map directly from Slurm:

- ``sacctmgr add account``, ``sacctmgr add user``, and ``sacctmgr add qos`` work as
  in Slurm, following the same ``cluster → account → user → association → QOS``
  ordering.
- The ``[accounting] require_qos`` setting is the equivalent of Slurm's
  ``AccountingStorageEnforce=qos``.
- The ``[accounting] require_association`` setting is the equivalent of Slurm's
  ``AccountingStorageEnforce=associations``.
- The ``default_qos`` setting is the equivalent of Slurm's fallback QOS.

See :doc:`/admin-guide/accounting` for the accounting concept guide.

.. tip::

   Before migrating a production workload, test the golden path on a small cluster
   first: submit a job (``sbatch``), check the queue (``squeue``), cancel a job
   (``scancel``), and review accounting history (``sacct``).
